# CSS Color Markers Project

This is my CSS Color Markers project, created as part of the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design certification. I built a set of colored markers to learn different ways of defining colors in CSS.

## Project Overview

The CSS Color Markers project helped me understand various color representation methods in CSS. By creating a set of digital markers with different colors, I explored RGB values, hex codes, HSL values, and gradients.

## What I Learned

Through this project, I practiced:
- Using different CSS color representation methods (RGB, hex, HSL)
- Creating color gradients with linear-gradient()
- Implementing shadows with box-shadow property
- Building visual elements using nested divs
- Structuring related elements with container classes
- Applying opacity and transparency to colors
- Understanding color theory and combinations
- Creating 3D-like effects with shading

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3

## Project Structure

- `index.html` - The HTML structure with marker elements and their components
- `styles.css` - The CSS file containing all the color definitions and styling

## Design Elements

The markers feature:
- Red, green, and blue color themes
- Sleeves and caps to create realistic marker appearances
- Shadow effects for dimension
- Gradient effects to simulate reflections and highlights
- Different opacity levels for visual interest

This project really helped me understand how colors work in web design. Learning different ways to represent the same color gave me flexibility in my coding approach, and I now feel confident using various color models in my projects.
